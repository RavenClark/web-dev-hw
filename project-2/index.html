      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The paper crane is the perfect place to start if you are looking to learn the art of origami. It is one of the most common paper constructions and is fairly simple to learn. The instructions below are meant to be easy to follow and will have you creating
        origami in no time.

      <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
      <!-- step one -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/square.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 1: Create Square</h4>
          <p>
            If you aren't using precut origami paper, using your ruler and scissors cut your sheet into a square. I recommend a 5x5in. square.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step two -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/x-folds.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 2: X Folds</h4>
          <p>
            The first step is to fold the square diagonally, corner to corner. Repeat the same process again so that it looks like an x on your paper. Make sure that you properly align the edges or else your crane won't fold as well. Make sure it is as perfect as
            possible.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step three -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/+-fold.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 3: + Folds</h4>
          <p>
            The second step is to flip the paper over and fold the paper in half horizontally. Repeat this process again so that your paper looks like a + and a x on top of each other. Make sure it is pefect just like with the x. Making sure your folds are aligned
            perfectly.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step four -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/accordian-fold.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 4: Accordion Fold</h4>
          <p>
            Open the square up, keeping the colored side down. Turn the square so that one of the corners is pointing at you. Bring the two side corners in to meet the corner on the table that's pointing at you. (like pictured) Take the top corner that's still sticking
            up and press it down to join the other corners, creating an accordion folded square.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step five -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/superman-fold.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 5: Superman Fold</h4>
          <p>
            With the 'flap' corners still facing you, take the top right hand corner of the square and fold it into the center diagonal line of the square. The result of your folds will look a bit like the Superman logo shape. Repeat this with the left top corner.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step six -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/top-fold.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 6: Top Fold</h4>
          <p>
            Once both parts are folded in pull the top part down and press the crease.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step seven -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/frogmouth-to-diamond-fold.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 7: Frog Mouth to Diamond Fold</h4>
          <p>
            After you have both halves of the triangle pulled in pull them back out and lift up the top piece of paper. Next, lift up the top front corner and hold down the other three front corners. Pull the top corner up. It should look look like a frogs mouth.
            The next part is a bit tricky. Pull the top corner all the up and back so that the top piece lies flat. Carefully press all the folds down so that you end up with a diamond shape on top of the bottom diagonal square.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step eight -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/press-repeat.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 8: Press Repeat</h4>
          <p>
            Flip the paper over and repeat Steps 5-7 to the other side.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step nine -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/skinny-kite-fold.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 9: Skinny Kite Fold</h4>
          <p>
            Next, fold the right top corner of the diamond in to meet the center line. Press down that fold. Repeat this for the left top corner. Flip the paper over and repeat the above steps for the other side. You'll end up with something that looks a bit like
            a skinny kite shape.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step ten -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/wolfshead-fold.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 10: Wolf's Head Fold</h4>
          <p>
            Now, lift up the top right side and press it over to the other side, like turning a page in a book. Press down the middle fold. Flip the paper over and repeat this in the same direction, right to left, on the other side. You will end up with a very elongated
            'wolf's head' shape.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step eleven -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/snoutflip-fold.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 11: Snout Filp Fold</h4>
          <p>
            Lift up the wolfs snout and fold it so it meets with the tips of the ears. Press that new fold down. Flip the paper over and repeat on the other side.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step twelve -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/book-fold.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 12: Book Fold</h4>
          <p>
            Like you did in Step 9, fold the right side top layer of the paper in a book fold, from right to left. Flip the paper over and repeat on the other side.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step thirteen -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/headsandtails-fold.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 13: Heads and Tails Fold</h4>
          <p>
            Next, you pull out the long pieces of paper (the head/neck & tail). Pull them both out so that they line up with the angle of the body fold. (like pictured) Bend the top of one side down to make the head.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step fourteen -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/flap-folds.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 14: Flap Fold</h4>
          <p>
            Fold both wings down where two different angles meet on the wing flaps. Press the folds.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- step fifteen -->
      <div class="step">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/puff-up.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Step 15: Puff it up</h4>
          <p>
            To finish off the crane and make it able to stand, gently pull the wings apart where they're folded. Then turn the crane upside down and gently pull the opposite corners apart to finish opening up the body. You can also try blowing into the hole on the
            bottom as you pulll out the wings to make sure you're crane's body is puffed out. Be careful to not pull out the wings too much or they'll rip. If the wings rip you will have to restart your crane with a new piece of paper.
          </p>

          <h4>Step 16: Congrats! You're Finished</h4>
