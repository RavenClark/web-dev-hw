# Assignment 2
A version control system is a software source control manager that allows for progress and changes to be made to a file. A VCS records changes that have been made and key information about them which can be referred back on. We are using a Version Control System in this course because one of its main abilities is that it allows for collaboration on projects amongst knowledge workers.

My work cycle went relatively smoothly for this assignment. All of this information is very new to me, so I have been re-reading all of the course material, but I think I am beginning to get the hang of it.
