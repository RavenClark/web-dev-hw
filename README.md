# My First README.md
## Raven Clark
I decided to take this course because I wanted to expand my knowledge of how websites and the internet work. I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of this tool that I rely on and use every single day.  In addition, I took this course because I work a lot in the schoolâ€™s content managing system, Cascade, as part of my work study positions and thought that this course would help me in that regard.  
* I was interested to learn why the internet and the web are two different things."The internet connects participants and the web connects information."  
* The internet is a wire.  
* Tim Berners-Lee is the computer scientist credited with creating the World Wide Web.
