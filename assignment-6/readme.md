# Technical Report

For this project I wanted to create a page based around Midcentury modern design, specifically in the 1950s. I chose the red organic shape graphic that was provided as my main inspiration for this page. I researched Midcentury modern color palettes and split up this page using these colors.

My color palette is in alignment with the Midcentury modern themes. I chose more subdued, but complimentary tones. The colors that I used were #FFFFFF, #ADD8E6, #B0D197, and #F5DEB3.

My work cycle for this project was pretty consistent. I struggled a bit finding unique ways to style my page, but I hope with more practice I will be able to improve my designs.
